Algorithm

Step 1- basic

x = buy price + buy fee
y = current price + sell fee
z = y - x 
if(z < 0) //if you sell and you made a loss
    don't sell
else //calculate profit
     if(z > minimum_profit)
	sell

--------------------------------
Step 2 - using RSI


rsi< 30 = buy with 1/5th of the total
assign coin price as var A
else, do nothing

after 5 mins, check rsi again
if rsi< 30 assign coin price as var b
if var b< a, buy with with another 1/5th
else, do nothing


after 5 mins, check rsi again
if rsi > 65, sell with
((a+b)/2 * 1.03) + fee
-----------------------------
if market price is greater than our average, sell at market price

if market price is lesser than our average, sell only if we get at least 1% profit

--------------------------------
IF - Sell order gets posted but not settled and rsi tells to buy again
THEN - Buy only if price is lower than the lowest settled buy


Only clear all tables if sell gets settled



-------------------------------------
Fix for buying algo

If Rsi < 30

If nothing on table exists (0) then buy market price

if((float(currentRSIPrice + percentLessThanPrevBuy) < float(lastBuyPrice) or int(lastBuyPrice) == 0) and float(usdBalace) >= pricePerOrder)

Else if Market price < Previous buy then buy market price 



IF - 



Future algo:
If we need to cancel an order
Checkbox for which indicator to use 
Order of checks
stop-loss = stop when price hit a certain point in a small amount of time
